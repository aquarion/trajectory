## Vignettes

These are launchpads. They're rough sketches of a universe, and may contain details that don't make it all the way through to the game. They're presented in order written. Titles may not remain either.

* [[The Caravans are a Milk Run]] (System Introduction)
* Shipshape & Bristol Fashion
* [[The Ballet of the Ships is incredible]] (Hyperspace)
* [[Kelpable]] (Justice)
* The bell of the fifth hour after rise
* If you understand anything, understand the sequence
* Prepare for Bluedark/Blackout, Action stations
* Better than everyone
* Eventually

## [[Faith]]

* What We Can Do Together
* Our Manefest Genetic Destiny
* Grand Romantic Schemes

## [[Paths]]

They're not races, not really. But they're not classes either. Consider it a Lineage, in a way. I'm calling them Paths, for now. They're not skillsets, either.

* The [[Lintilian]] - Define 'mortality', exactly.
* The [[Improved]] - It's not that we're better, we're just... above.
* The Equality
* The Seed
* The Destiny

## The [[Syndicates]]

These are where the factions are: [[Your Own Space Ship]]

* The [[Second Reconnaissance]] - Social construction architects.
* Jone's Frontier

## Observations

* This is intended as gender-equal setting, gendered language is used by example and narrative, but if we fuck up the balance, [that's a bug](/aquarion/trajectory/issues)
