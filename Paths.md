Everyone is human, but some are more human than others.

Technology is a weird thing. Biochemistry is a weird thing. They're weird, but somewhat incompatible, because getting tech to interface with non-standard bioc is hard, and bioc tends to get a bit .... fritzy when combined with advanced tech.

This is where "Races" might go in other games. Any race can be part of any Syndicate, but it affects which Skills you can get, and which are easier for you to get. As ever, we start with in-universe vinettes, and will move on to mechanics later on.
