title: Syndicates
author: Nicholas Avenell
--- 
<p>Space ships are expensive, too much for any one group to afford. Fortunately, the really expensive bits - the hull - are available for rent by a few Syndicates, so long as you subscribe to their view of the universe...</p>

<p>Syndicates are the group-cohesion level of factions for the game. They're the people who lent you this ship, the people who will want you to do something for them at some point. Different syndicates have different levels of involvement in their crew, and this will differ on a colony-by-colony basis too (Some colonies are highly populated with a single syndicate. Some are syndicates you know and love gone slightly feral. Some your superiors may not exist at all...).</p>

<p>Each syndicate will get some introductory world-building, and then some light system mechanics for each. They differ by philosophy, but within those philsosophies is a lot of scope for neuance. or flat out war...</p>
